# Personal Information Environment (PIE)

PIE is a framework for text “development” and Information Management, especially for XML enthusiast.

## Concept of PIE

- use of Pareto rule: with 20% of code for 80% fulfilment of needs and keep it simple
- people with XML experience (or interest)
- use of popular (free) tools
  - GNU Emacs (my favorite environment, emacs lisp glue included)
  - Freemind
  - graphviz
  - web browsers (Mozilla Firefox, MS IE)
  - LaTeX, PDFLaTeX
- portability (source code and XSLT)
- file based (no database server)
- simple markup only for a good plain text readability (Editor, E-Mail)

Writing as a text development
- different views on one document: Structure, Article, Presentation, Calendar
  - a structure view (Tree, Mindmap, “Mindtree”)
  - a search tool with context informations
- “rapid prototyping” of documents using mindmaps (oriented on   structure not layout)
- comment or skip regions without deleting them

3) new features like Todo list, Journal, project planning
4) better implementation in C (C++ compatible)
